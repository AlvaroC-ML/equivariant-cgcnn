## GVP Model

### This code creates a GNN architecture I designed which uses Geometric Vector Perceptrons (GVPs).

The reason why I use GVPs is because of their rotational equivariance. For more details about why this is a desired quality, please wait until I have finished my paper explaining the math behind this. As a SULI intern, I have to write this paper. It will contain all the details about what exactly this architecture does.
